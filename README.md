# Reboot to ...

This is a small Gnome extension that adds the ability to reboot directly to an entity of the boot-loader. This is a fork of the way better extentions [Reboot to UEFI](https://github.com/UbayGD/reboottouefi) by [UbayGD](https://github.com/UbayGD/). This will also add the UEFI entry to the menu, so you don't need both extensions.

This extension rely on the DBus interface `org.freedesktop.login1` to both discover entries and request the reboot.
